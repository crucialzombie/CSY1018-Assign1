      Let's talk about my fitness lifestyle. I am a fitness addict and cannot see myself
      surviving wthout it. I was introduced to fitness during my High School years.
      I had stopped dancing at that time and wanted to express my physical activity
      in another way, which is when i joined a local gym where i found i had a passion
      for fitness too.
