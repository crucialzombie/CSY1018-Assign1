      Let's talk about my fitness lifestyle. I am a fitness addict and cannot see myself
      surviving wthout it. I was introduced to fitness during my High School years.
      I had stopped dancing at that time and wanted to express my physical activity
      in another way, which is when i joined a local gym where i found i had a passion
      for fitness too.

    As much as i like fitness and dancing, animals are one of my
    weak points, especially dogs. I just love dogs, whether ther are street dogs,
    or any other dogs.
    It was the love for dogs which made me get my own dog. He's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocker_Spaniel">cocker spainel.<a>
